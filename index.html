        About
      </h2>
      <div>
        Hi, I study mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan. I'm originally from the Chicago suburbs and chose to attend the University of Michigan because I loved its engineering program and was drawn toward city of Ann Arbor and the Big House.
        Now I'm involved in Engineering Global Leadership program and outside of work really enjoy cycling, rock climbing, and practicing yoga. I hope to one day merge my technical knowledge in mechanical engineering with my interest in design and operations
        to create sustainable energy solutions. I've done this sort of work at PG&E last summer through my Tauber project as well as right now as I'm on co-op at Tesla.  Here is my  <a href="Madeline Gilleran Resume.pdf">resume</a>
    if you are interested!
